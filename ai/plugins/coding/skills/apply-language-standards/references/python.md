# Python

Apply only to an actual project using this technology. Read the bundle's entry
and requirements first. Project versions, constraints and existing tools override
the topic inventory below; inherited version labels are examples, not minimum
requirements or claims of current support. Verify relevant APIs against official
documentation for the installed version before relying on them.

## Standards

Use the declared interpreter/environment and configured typing/formatting tools. Preserve exceptions and serialization, own async lifetimes and resource cleanup, and test actual boundaries.

## Conditional topic inventory

These are investigation topics, not a setup plan, required dependencies, acceptance
criteria or instructions to execute changes. No universal latency, coverage,
deployment or architecture target applies. Load only relevant sections.
